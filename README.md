# Pomodoro
Pomodoro is a GNOME Shell extension that integrates the Pomodoro technique directly into the top bar. It allows you to configure the duration of work sessions and breaks (short/long), displays notifications when sessions start and end, and records study time and completed sessions for simple statistics.
